### DATAFLOW DIAGRAM - Detailed Processes

The below detailed DFD provides a clear overview of the data flow within the system, specifying the type of data being passed around in each process.

**The Overall System**

![Overall System DFD](./src/docs/dataflows/level-0-overall-system-dfd.png)

Each block diagram below represents a distinct functionality of the above mentioned system. 

![Institution Registration](./src/docs/dataflows/1-detailed-dfd-institution-rego.drawio.png)

**Overview**  
Institution Admin submits registration information (Name, Email, Institute Name, Institute Id).  
The system validates and stores the information in the database.  
A confirmation email is sent to the admin.

**Purpose**  
The institution registration process allows educational institutions to create accounts on the platform. It collects essential information to authenticate and set up profiles for these institutions.  

**Functionality**  
Data Collection: The registration form collects the institution admin's name, official email, institution name, registration number, and a password.  
Validation and Storage: The information provided is validated to ensure it meets the system's requirements (e.g., valid email format, strong password) and then stored securely in the database.  
Immediate Access: Once registered, the institution admin can immediately access the system to manage student data, without the need for email confirmation.  

**Technical Implementation**  
Database Operations: Uses CRUD operations to create a new institution record in the database.  
Security Measures: Passwords are hashed before storage to enhance security.  

![User Login](./src/docs/dataflows/2-detailed-dfd-user-login.drawio.png)

**Overview**  
Institution Admin submits login credentials (Email, Password).  
The system authenticates the user and generates an authentication token.  

**Purpose**  
The user login process authenticates institution admins when they attempt to access their accounts, ensuring that only authorized users can manage sensitive student information.  

**Functionality**  
Credentials Verification: Admins log in using their registered email and password.  
Authentication Token: Upon successful authentication, the system generates an authentication token which is used for session management and securing subsequent requests.  
Security Features: Includes measures to prevent unauthorized access and attacks such as brute force.  

**Technical Implementation**  
Session Management: Typically involves generating a secure token (e.g., JWT) that maintains user state across requests.  
Security Checks: Might include rate limiting and automatic lockout after several failed attempts.  

![Manage Students](./src/docs/dataflows/3-detailed-dfd-manage-students.drawio.png)

**Overview**  
Institution Admin sends student details (Name, DOB, Gender, etc.) along with the token.  
The system processes the student data, storing or retrieving it from the database.  

**Purpose**  
This process allows institution admins to add, update, delete, and retrieve detailed information about students, maintaining a robust database of student records.

**Functionality**  
CRUD Operations: Admins can create new student records, read existing ones, update details, or delete records as needed.  
Search and Filtering: Provides functionality to search for specific students or filter lists based on criteria like enrollment date or area of study.  
Data Integrity: Ensures that all student information is accurately recorded and maintained.  

**Technical Implementation**  
Database Transactions: Ensures atomic operations for data integrity and error handling.  
Input Validation: Protects the system from invalid or harmful input.  

![Generate Reports](./src/docs/dataflows/4-detailed-dfd-generate-reports.drawio.png)

**Overview**  
Institution Admin requests reports.  
The system processes the report request, retrieves data from the database, and returns the report data.  

**Purpose**  
This feature allows the generation of reports based on the student data available. These reports can help admins track enrollment, performance, and other metrics over specified periods.  

**Functionality**  
Report Customization: Admins can generate reports based on various criteria (e.g., time frames, specific programs).  
Data Aggregation: The system aggregates data from multiple records to compile comprehensive reports.  
Export Options: In phase 2 of this project in the future, we can look at the ability to export reports in various formats like PDF or Excel.  

**Technical Implementation**  
Data Analysis Tools: May use SQL queries or specialized software libraries to analyze and format data.  
Asynchronous Processing: Large report generation tasks may be processed in the background to avoid blocking the main application workflow.  

![Notifications](./src/docs/dataflows/5-detailed-dfd-notifications.drawio.png)

**Overview**  
Institution Admin sends a notification request.  
The system processes the request and sends the notification via an external notification service.  
The "Notifications" process in the system serves a key role in communicating timely and relevant information to institution admins or other relevant stakeholders.  

**NOTE**: Majority of the notification features (mentioned below) can be implemented in the future, as a part of phase 2. For Phase 1, we will have simple & relevant notifications only. But, we are presenting all the possibilities for you to get an idea.

**Purpose**

1. **Timely Alerts**: The notification system can alert institution admins about important events or statuses within the application. For example, if there is an update to a student's records, or a deadline approaching for report submissions, the system can automatically notify the admins.

2. **Actionable Reminders**: Notifications can serve as reminders for actions that need to be taken. For instance, reminding admins of incomplete registration processes, pending approvals, or actions required after a certain trigger within the system.

3. **Error Alerts**: If there are errors in the system, such as failed data submissions or conflicts in schedules, notifications can alert the admin immediately, allowing for swift resolution.

4. **System Updates**: When there are updates or changes in the system, notifications can inform all users of these changes. This might include new features, maintenance times, or changes in terms or policies.

5. **User Engagement**: Regular notifications can help keep users engaged with the system, prompting them to return to the platform regularly, which can enhance user retention and satisfaction.

### Functionality of Notifications

- **Triggered by Specific Events**: Notifications are typically triggered by specific events within the system. For example, when a new student is enrolled, a notification might be sent to the admin to review and confirm the details.

- **Customizable**: Depending on the system's design, notifications can often be customized by the admins to control what types of notifications they receive, how often they receive them, and through what channels (e.g., email, SMS, system pop-ups).

- **Automated**: The notification process is usually automated. Once the triggers and types of notifications are defined, the system can handle the sending of these alerts without manual intervention.

- **Integrated with External Services**: To send notifications, especially through email or SMS, the system may integrate with external notification services or APIs that handle the actual delivery of these messages.

### Technical Implementation

- **External Notification Services**: For email and SMS, services like Twilio for SMS or SendGrid for email might be used. These services provide reliable delivery and management of notification services.

- **In-System Notifications**: For notifications that appear within the web application, technologies like WebSocket can be used for real-time communication, or simpler polling mechanisms could be employed depending on the application's requirements.

- **Database Monitoring**: The system will likely have mechanisms to monitor changes in the database or specific tables that trigger notifications. This could be implemented via database triggers or by application logic that checks for certain conditions during data processing.

By incorporating a robust notification system, the student management platform can enhance its interactivity and responsiveness, significantly improving the user experience for institution admins. This system can keep users well-informed and engaged, making the platform more effective and efficient.


### Key Points from the Dataflow Diagram
Each process (Institution Registration, User Login, Manage Students, Generate Reports, Notifications) is a separate block that interacts with the database and external systems.  
The user interface communicates with each of these processes independently based on the user's actions.  
Data such as registration info, credentials, student details, report requests, and notifications are passed between the user interface and the respective processes.  
Each process communicates with the database to store and retrieve relevant data.  
External systems are used for tasks like generating authentication tokens and sending notifications.  

This comprehensive DFD shows how the data flows between the different parts of the system, providing a detailed overview of the interactions and data exchanges within the application.

- **Redux Store**: Used for managing the application state, ensuring a predictable and consistent state across the app.
- **Axios/Fetch**: HTTP clients for making API calls to the backend server.

#### Server Side (Backend)
- **Express.js Server**: The core of the backend, handling incoming HTTP requests and routing them to the appropriate endpoints.
- **Routes**: Define the API endpoints (e.g., /register, /students) and link them to controllers.
- **Middleware**: Includes authentication (e.g., JWT), validation, and error handling to process and secure the requests.
- **Controllers**: Handle the logic for each endpoint, interacting with the services to perform CRUD operations.
- **Services**: Business logic and interaction with the database, abstracting the database operations from the controllers.

#### Database
- **MongoDB**: The NoSQL database for storing institution and student data.
- **Collections**: Logical groupings of documents (e.g., Institutions, Students).
- **Documents**: Individual records in the collections.
- **Mongoose**: An ORM for MongoDB, providing a schema-based solution to model the application data and interact with MongoDB.

This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, with the frontend and backend interacting through well-defined API endpoints, and the database being managed through an ORM for ease of use and maintenance.

## Kanban board screenshots

The various to-do tasks for the preparation of this project documentation was managed via a 3-lane Kanban board using **Notion**. Notion is a productivity and note-taking web application. It is very similar to the propular apps like Trello and Evernote.   

Since the web app project involved 2 separate work - the documentation and the building of the app, I have created 3 Kanban boards within a single project page on Notion - the documentation (Part A), the Client side (Part B) and the Server side (Part B).

The Kanban board features 3 swimlanes - **Not Started**, **In Progress** and **Done**. All the required activities are first set as tasks in the **Not Started** column, and when the task is to be actioned, it is moved to the **In Progress** column. Once the task is completed, the task card is moved into the **Done** column.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
