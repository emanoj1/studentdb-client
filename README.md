### DATAFLOW DIAGRAM - Detailed Processes

The below detailed DFD provides a clear overview of the data flow within the system, specifying the type of data being passed around in each process.

**The Overall System**

![Overall System DFD](./src/docs/dataflows/level-0-overall-system-dfd.png)

Each block diagram below represents a distinct functionality of the above mentioned system. 

![Institution Registration](./src/docs/dataflows/1-detailed-dfd-institution-rego.drawio.png)

**Overview**  
Institution Admin submits registration information (Name, Email, Institute Name, Institute Id).  
The system validates and stores the information in the database.  
A confirmation email is sent to the admin.

**Purpose**  
The institution registration process allows educational institutions to create accounts on the platform. It collects essential information to authenticate and set up profiles for these institutions.  

**Functionality**  
Data Collection: The registration form collects the institution admin's name, official email, institution name, registration number, and a password.  
Validation and Storage: The information provided is validated to ensure it meets the system's requirements (e.g., valid email format, strong password) and then stored securely in the database.  
Immediate Access: Once registered, the institution admin can immediately access the system to manage student data, without the need for email confirmation.  

**Technical Implementation**  
Database Operations: Uses CRUD operations to create a new institution record in the database.  
Security Measures: Passwords are hashed before storage to enhance security.  

![User Login](./src/docs/dataflows/2-detailed-dfd-user-login.drawio.png)

**Overview**  
Institution Admin submits login credentials (Email, Password).  
The system authenticates the user and generates an authentication token.  

**Purpose**  
The user login process authenticates institution admins when they attempt to access their accounts, ensuring that only authorized users can manage sensitive student information.  

**Functionality**  
Credentials Verification: Admins log in using their registered email and password.  
Authentication Token: Upon successful authentication, the system generates an authentication token which is used for session management and securing subsequent requests.  
Security Features: Includes measures to prevent unauthorized access and attacks such as brute force.  

**Technical Implementation**  
Session Management: Typically involves generating a secure token (e.g., JWT) that maintains user state across requests.  
Security Checks: Might include rate limiting and automatic lockout after several failed attempts.  

![Manage Students](./src/docs/dataflows/3-detailed-dfd-manage-students.drawio.png)

**Overview**  
Institution Admin sends student details (Name, DOB, Gender, etc.) along with the token.  
The system processes the student data, storing or retrieving it from the database.  

**Purpose**  
This process allows institution admins to add, update, delete, and retrieve detailed information about students, maintaining a robust database of student records.

**Functionality**  
CRUD Operations: Admins can create new student records, read existing ones, update details, or delete records as needed.  
Search and Filtering: Provides functionality to search for specific students or filter lists based on criteria like enrollment date or area of study.  
Data Integrity: Ensures that all student information is accurately recorded and maintained.  

**Technical Implementation**  
Database Transactions: Ensures atomic operations for data integrity and error handling.  
Input Validation: Protects the system from invalid or harmful input.  

![Generate Reports](./src/docs/dataflows/4-detailed-dfd-generate-reports.drawio.png)

**Overview**  
Institution Admin requests reports.  
The system processes the report request, retrieves data from the database, and returns the report data.  

**Purpose**  
This feature allows the generation of reports based on the student data available. These reports can help admins track enrollment, performance, and other metrics over specified periods.  

**Functionality**  
Report Customization: Admins can generate reports based on various criteria (e.g., time frames, specific programs).  
Data Aggregation: The system aggregates data from multiple records to compile comprehensive reports.  
Export Options: In phase 2 of this project in the future, we can look at the ability to export reports in various formats like PDF or Excel.  

**Technical Implementation**  
Data Analysis Tools: May use SQL queries or specialized software libraries to analyze and format data.  
Asynchronous Processing: Large report generation tasks may be processed in the background to avoid blocking the main application workflow.  

![Notifications](./src/docs/dataflows/5-detailed-dfd-notifications.drawio.png)

**Overview**  
Institution Admin sends a notification request.  
The system processes the request and sends the notification via an external notification service.  
The "Notifications" process in the system serves a key role in communicating timely and relevant information to institution admins or other relevant stakeholders.  

**NOTE**: Majority of the notification features (mentioned below) can be implemented in the future, as a part of phase 2. For Phase 1, we will have simple & relevant notifications only. But, we are presenting all the possibilities for you to get an idea.

**Purpose**

1. **Timely Alerts**: The notification system can alert institution admins about important events or statuses within the application. For example, if there is an update to a student's records, or a deadline approaching for report submissions, the system can automatically notify the admins.

2. **Actionable Reminders**: Notifications can serve as reminders for actions that need to be taken. For instance, reminding admins of incomplete registration processes, pending approvals, or actions required after a certain trigger within the system.

3. **Error Alerts**: If there are errors in the system, such as failed data submissions or conflicts in schedules, notifications can alert the admin immediately, allowing for swift resolution.

4. **System Updates**: When there are updates or changes in the system, notifications can inform all users of these changes. This might include new features, maintenance times, or changes in terms or policies.

5. **User Engagement**: Regular notifications can help keep users engaged with the system, prompting them to return to the platform regularly, which can enhance user retention and satisfaction.

### Functionality of Notifications

- **Triggered by Specific Events**: Notifications are typically triggered by specific events within the system. For example, when a new student is enrolled, a notification might be sent to the admin to review and confirm the details.

- **Customizable**: Depending on the system's design, notifications can often be customized by the admins to control what types of notifications they receive, how often they receive them, and through what channels (e.g., email, SMS, system pop-ups).

- **Automated**: The notification process is usually automated. Once the triggers and types of notifications are defined, the system can handle the sending of these alerts without manual intervention.

- **Integrated with External Services**: To send notifications, especially through email or SMS, the system may integrate with external notification services or APIs that handle the actual delivery of these messages.

### Technical Implementation

- **External Notification Services**: For email and SMS, services like Twilio for SMS or SendGrid for email might be used. These services provide reliable delivery and management of notification services.

- **In-System Notifications**: For notifications that appear within the web application, technologies like WebSocket can be used for real-time communication, or simpler polling mechanisms could be employed depending on the application's requirements.

- **Database Monitoring**: The system will likely have mechanisms to monitor changes in the database or specific tables that trigger notifications. This could be implemented via database triggers or by application logic that checks for certain conditions during data processing.

By incorporating a robust notification system, the student management platform can enhance its interactivity and responsiveness, significantly improving the user experience for institution admins. This system can keep users well-informed and engaged, making the platform more effective and efficient.


### Key Points from the Dataflow Diagram
Each process (Institution Registration, User Login, Manage Students, Generate Reports, Notifications) is a separate block that interacts with the database and external systems.  
The user interface communicates with each of these processes independently based on the user's actions.  
Data such as registration info, credentials, student details, report requests, and notifications are passed between the user interface and the respective processes.  
Each process communicates with the database to store and retrieve relevant data.  
External systems are used for tasks like generating authentication tokens and sending notifications.  

This comprehensive DFD shows how the data flows between the different parts of the system, providing a detailed overview of the interactions and data exchanges within the application.

# R6 Kanban board screenshots

The various to-do tasks for the preparation of this project documentation was managed via a 3-lane Kanban board using **Notion**. Notion is a productivity and note-taking web application. It is very similar to the propular apps like Trello and Evernote.   

Since the web app project involved 2 separate work - the documentation and the building of the app, I have created 3 Kanban boards within a single project page on Notion - the documentation (Part A), the Client side (Part B) and the Server side (Part B).

The Kanban board features 3 swimlanes - **Not Started**, **In Progress** and **Done**. All the required activities are first set as tasks in the **Not Started** column, and when the task is to be actioned, it is moved to the **In Progress** column. Once the task is completed, the task card is moved into the **Done** column.

# PART B

# R1 Tech stack used

The web app was developed using the MERN tech stack.

![](./src/docs/images/mern-logo.png)

**MongoDB**: For the database to store student and institution data.  
**Express.js**: For the back-end server to handle API requests and manage data transactions.  
**React.js**: For the front-end, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.  
**Node.js**: For the server-side runtime environment, ensuring efficient handling of concurrent operations.  

# R2 Well designed code
The code was written keeping in mind the industry best practices and code organization. 
- Separated modules were used in both frontend and backend to manage each function/focus. Not only does this help the code arrangement look neat, but it also aides in quick troubleshooting. 
- Care was also taken to follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding principles.
- An extensive list of libraries were used in this project for both the client and server sides:

### Server-Side Libraries (in studentdb-server):  
**express**: A web framework for Node.js to create server-side applications.  
**mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.  
**bcryptjs**: A library to hash passwords.  
**dotenv**: A module to load environment variables from a .env file.  
**jsonwebtoken**: A library to generate and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.  
**body-parser**: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before handlers.  
**cors**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) with various options.  
**nodemon**: A tool that helps develop Node.js applications by automatically restarting the server when file changes are detected.  

### Dev Dependencies (for testing):  
**jest**: A testing framework for JavaScript.  
**supertest**: A library for testing Node.js HTTP servers using a high-level API.  

### Client-Side Libraries:  

**@testing-library/react**: A library for testing React components.  
**react-router-dom**: A library that enables routing in React applications.  
**axios (used in tests)**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.  


# R3 Employing a source control methodology

![](./src/docs/images/git-hub-logo-octocat.png)

GitHub was the chosen tool to manage all source control, and it was made easier using GitHun Desktop.   
2 repositories were used - one for the frontend and another for the backend.
![GitHub Repos](./src/docs/images/github-repo-ss.png)

You can view the repos here:ðŸ‘‡    
**Client/Frontend**: https://github.com/emanoj1/studentdb-client  
**Server/Backend**: https://github.com/emanoj1/studentdb-server  

Branches were used for specific functions, and when everything seemed to be working, they were pushed across to the main.
![GitHub Brances](./src/docs/images/github-branches-ss.png)

All changes were checked extensively on the localhost before their push to the `main` branch. 

# R4 Ability to work in a team

This was a solo project, and hence the owner of this repo (Manoj Kumar) was THE team! However, I worked with a team mindset using traits such as patience, delegating work to different days (rather than a person), and going over and above to provide as much information & work that can help this project succeed.  

In terms of work management, I used a Kanban board on [Notion](https://notion.so), where I separated the work into Part-A and Part-B, and assigned swimlanes (not started, in progress, done) to manage the work, as what I would've done if we had a team managing different aspects of the web app design.

In this way, I was able to demostrate:
- the use of a recognised project management methodology
- the use of a recognized task delegation methodology  

# R5 A working application

The initial development phase of the application focused on "soft launching" on the localhost, where all the working and key functions of the web app was showcased **minus the visual design**:

**Logged-out State**
- Home page with placeholder content
- An About page with placeholder content
- A Contact page with placeholder content
- A working Login page with basic Username and Password fields
- A Registration page with basic fields (Name, Email, Password, Institute Name & ID#)
- A navigation bar across all pages with links to the above pages
- A sample logo

**Logged-in state**
- The Admin landing page (once logged-in) presented basic student record stats
- Also, featured the links to Add Student, Edit Student, Delete Student and Update Admin records.
- Logout button

All of the above was styled in minimalist colors (standard black & white). 

All the API endpoints were tested using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) to ensure everything was working.

The aim of the providing a "working application" was to show the "client" that all the key functions of the app was working and to check if anything required an update. Once all the issues were sorted and matched the project scope perfectly, the styling commenced towards the backend phase of the project.

# R6 Deploying the app to a cloud hosting service

Once all the key features (_page navigation, login, registration, password resets, student CRUD operations_) were working perfectly, all styling completed (_colors, fonts_) and all content added to the respective pages, the project moved to its deployment phase to a cloud hosting service.
- the frontend was deployed on [Netlify](https://netify.com)
- the backend was deployed on [Render](https://render.com)
- the database was deployed on [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com)

Below are the deployed links:
- Deployed production (Client/Frontend): https://studentdbonline.netlify.app/
- Deployed production (Server/backend): https://studentdb-server.onrender.com

Below are some views from their dashboards:

**1. Deployment on Netlify (the frontend)**

# R7 An application with an intuitive user interface

The website features a minimalist design for both is style and functions. Only few colors are used for section separation, the standout of the navigation bar, and bright buttons for key user operations.

### Homepage
![Homepage full view](./src/docs/images/full-page-screen-capture-studentdb-homepage.png)

The Homepage features the following prominently:
- The nav bar with items to navigate to.
- The Login & Register buttons are bright & boxed for quick spotting.
- A hero section in the beginning with an elevator pitch
- 6 sections showcasing the features & benefits of the site, images from the dashboard for the user to see how it looks "inside" or the backend before signing up, a video tour of the full website, testimonials from signed-up users and finally a link to the contact page.

### Registration page
![Rego page](./src/docs/images/registration-page.png)

This is the most important page! Registration deals with collecting the institution admins signup details, as well as 3 security answers to assist in password reset.

The page is styled with a modern & youthful focus, using round-edged and shadowed input fields, and images.

### Login page  
![Login page](./src/docs/images/login-page.png)

The LOGIN page is a clutter-free page with 4 important items on it:
- Email field
- Password field
- The Login submit button
- A `Forgot Password` link to help reset the password

### Forgot Password page  
![Forgot password page](./src/docs/images/forgot-password-page.png)

This page helps a user log back in by setting up a new password provided he can answer the security answers he supplied when signing up. 

### Admin Dashboard - landing page  
![Admin dashboard](./src/docs/images/admin-dashboard-page.png)

This is the first page you see when you login to the site. It features a menu to the left that deals with the various CRUD operations and there is a logout button the top-left.

### Admin Dashboard - Student List page  
![Student List](./src/docs/images/student-list-page.png)

This page loads all the students in the database of that specific institute. it also features an Edit and a Delete button for student row.

### Admin Dashboard - Add Student page  
![Add Student](./src/docs/images/add-student-page.png)

As the name implies, the Add Student page is the place to begin your data entry work of adding students. Only the main information is required of the student, and upon submitting the form, it stays on the page to help you continue with the data entry work. If you want to see the student entered, you can navigate to the Student List page.

### Admin Dashboard - Admin Settings page  
![Admin Settings](./src/docs/images/admin-settings-page.png)

On this page, the logged-in Institute Admin can change their details, whether it be their name, email id, institute details, the security answers or their password. By default, it populates their name, contact email and institute details. Security related info is not displayed.

### Contact Us page  
![Contact](./src/docs/images/contact-page.png)

The Contact page uses a 3rd widget [Tally.so](https://tally.so) which is embedded to the page as an iFrame widget. Upon submission of content from this page, the information reaches the web app owner by email. Using 3rd party widget is far easier to implement and maintain compared to building a custom form on the page.

### LIVE Chat pop-up
![Chat box](./src/docs/images/chat-widget.png)

All pages of the website also feature a LIVE Chat bubble, also a 3rd party widget from [Tawk](https://tawk.to):

# R8 Evidence of user testing

#### What is it?
Every item on the website was manually checked to ensure that they were working as intended. The process starts with checking them on the development environment (localhost) and then checking them again once they are in production/deployed state.

So, the one document captured both the development and production statuses.

#### Where is it captured?
An excel document was maintained which listed all the items to be tested for each page of the website. This is the format:
- **Test #**: This is a serial number assigned to the test, as simple as 1,2,3, etc.
- **Testing Item**: A short info on what is going to be tested.
- **Definition**: A short info on what this specific test is about.
- **Input Command**: What should you action to get the test underway.
- **Expected Output**: What the expected result should you be when an action is performed.
- **Actual Result**: What was the result in reality you observed once the test was actioned.
- **Test Status**: The test is marked as PASSED or FAILED based on the outcome.
- **Tested Date**: The date on which the test was carried out.

![](./src/docs/images/user-test-row-headings.png)

Then, as the test begins the observations are entered into the appropriate columns.

If a test has failed, then the web developer goes back to the source code to troubleshoot, till the result is a PASSED STATUS.

#### How was the information/observation organized?
The excel document maintained multiple sheets (5 sheets), each one capturing a specific set of tests:

![](./src/docs/images/user-test-excel-sheets.png)

- **Device View**: Testing the bahaviour of the website for responsiveness (desktop, tablet & mobile).
- **Main Page Components**: Testing all the functions and features of the website (login, authentications, navigation to all pages, etc).
- **Navigation Bar**: Testing the navigation bar for responsiveness and how it behaves in logged-out state and logged-in state. 
- **Admin Dashboard**: Testing to see how the Admin (logged-in state) pages work (stats, CRUD operations, etc).
- **LIVE Chat Widget**: Test if the LIVE chat widget is working or not.

#### Evidence of the full testing

Below are screenshots of the Excel document showing the 5 main testing areas explained above:  

### Manual unit test website responsiveness

# R9 Utilising a formal testing framework

**Jest** is a popular testing framework for JavaScript applications, particularly well-suited for testing React applications. It provides a way to test our code and ensure that it works as expected.  

A total of 7 tests were done, 6 on the Client-side and 1 on the Server-side.  

Below are the Terminal results for each of the above tests:

### Client-side

**Test 1 - the Register button**  
![Jest-Register](./src/docs/images/jest-register-pass.png)  
This is the Jest test for the Register button on the navigation bar.  

**Test 2 - the Registration submission function**  
![Jest-Registration](./src/docs/images/jest-registration-pass.png)  
This is the Jest test for the Registration button.  

**Test 3 - the Login function**  
![Jest-Login](./src/docs/images/jest-login-pass.png)  
This is the Jest test for the Login button.  

**Test 4 - the Forgot Password function**  
![Jest-Password](./src/docs/images/jest-forgotpassword-pass.png)  
This is the Jest test for testing the Forgot Password button function.  

**Test 5 - the Student List function**  
![Jest-Contact](./src/docs/images/jest-contact-pass.png)  

**Test 6 - the Contact form widget**  
![Jest-Contact](./src/docs/images/jest-contact-pass.png)  
This is the Jest test for the Contact page. The aim is:  
- To test - the presence of the iFrame element on the Contact page  
- To test - the correctness of the src attribute of the iFrame  

### Server-side

**Test 6 - Check user login**  
![Jest-login](./src/docs/images/jest-server-login-test-pass.png)  

This test requires 2 steps:
- seed a test data (user details) into MongoDB
- test the login with the new details

A separate test MongoDB database & collections was created for it to work.

# R10 URL to the deployed website

The web app on its own domain is available here: [studentdb.online](https://studentdb.online)

In order to test the functionalities of the website in a logged-in state and test teh CRUD operations, I highly recommend you sign-up to the site, login with your new details, add some students, edit & delete them, and even check out updating your signup information as well!  

If that's too much work, you can use the below test logins:  
username: `tomg@onlymusicschool.com`   
password: `TomY2024*`  

# R11 GitHub repositories

The repositories are:   
Client/Frontend: https://github.com/emanoj1/studentdb-client  
Server/Backend: https://github.com/emanoj1/studentdb-server 

GitHub Desktop was used for the timely & consistent management of the repositories. Branches were used, which were then merged into `main` once everything was working.
