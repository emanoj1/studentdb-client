            <h3>Manoj Kumar</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Founder, Coder & Customer Support</p>
            <p>My name is Manoj Kumar, the SOLO brainchild behind this web app. I live in Sydney, Australia, where I work full-time in digital advertising technology while also studying to become a full stack web developer.</p>
            <p>I have been involved in the education sector for a very long time both in marketing & admin, and understand clearly the pain points faced by institutes in effective data management using technology. Combining all those experiences, I built this app as the first step in bringing efficiencies to your centre!  </p>
            <p>Additionally, I am an indie author in the making, having published my first childrenâ€™s picture book in 2024!</p>
            <p>I extend my heartfelt thanks to you for visiting this website, and I hope you enjoy using this app while supporting indie makers and their dreams. Your support motivates me to continue dreaming differently and creating unique products.</p>
