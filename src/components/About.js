            <h3>Manoj Kumar</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Founder, Coder & Customer Support</p>
            <p>My name is Manoj Kumar, the SOLO brainchild behind this web app. I live in Sydney, Australia, where I work full-time in digital advertising technology and a full-stack web developer.</p>
            <p>With extensive experience in both marketing and administration within the education sector, I understand the challenges that institutes face in effective data management. Drawing from this background, I developed this app as a first step toward enhancing operational efficiency at your institution.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I am an indie author in the making, having published my first childrenâ€™s picture book in 2024! Check that out here: <a href="https://www.chesterthedino.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chester, the Dino.</a></p>
            <p>I extend my heartfelt thanks to you for visiting this website, and I hope you enjoy using this app while supporting indie makers and their dreams. Your support motivates me to continue dreaming differently and creating unique products.</p>
